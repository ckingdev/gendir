# gendir

An implementation of the [generalized Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Dirichlet_distribution) and related tools.

The generalized Dirichlet distribution is distribution on the probability simplex that, while still conjugate to the 
multinomial distribution, is not in general neutral and allows for a more complex dependence behavior than the standard
Dirichlet. 

The intent is to implement the appropriate interfaces as used in `gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/distmv`.
